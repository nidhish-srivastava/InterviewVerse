* We all techies and even non techies give a lot of interviews,it gets very hard for us to maintain track of each.

* The solution to this problem is this Interview Tracker.

* Used MERN stack and involves typical CRUD functionality but solves the problem effectively.

* Search Topic from all the interview experiences and read your required ones

* Backend Deployment : https://vercel.com/nidhish-srivastava/inter-view-tracker-mern 

<!--Create login/signup functionality,then create the feature where people can connect when they read someone interview experience  -->
